What is the purpose of the try block in Python error handling?

Ans: The try block is used to encapsulate code that might raise an exception. 
The purpose of the try block is to identify code that might potentially throw an exception during execution. 
By placing this code inside try block, you're essentially telling Python to attempt to execute this code, if exception occurs,program should handle it gracefully.
